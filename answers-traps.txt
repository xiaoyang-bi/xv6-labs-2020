Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf? 
a0-a7; a2.

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.) 
compiler optimize it only left the ``li a2 12`` at 0x26. function is inlined.

At what address is the function printf located?
1528(ra) (It is 0x628 in my computer)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main? 
the address just behind jarl(It is 0x38 in my computer)

Run the following code.
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

No, using C languange can direct read 57616 as int and transfer to hex.


In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
      

Random value
